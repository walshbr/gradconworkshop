To see how it works, you can click on the code block below and change \"4 + 4\" to be something else. Then click the little \"play\" button to the left of the block for it to run. Each of these code blocks is a little bit of Python, a computer programming language, and clicking the button let's us see the results of our output. They run in sequence as we move down the page, so the last code block might make assumptions about what has happened earlier in the page. "

What source texts are they using to build their model, which will then be applied elsewhere? NLTK is built on Wall Street Journal texts, while SpaCy has more of a cross-genre approach. How well can tags built from newspapers apply to poetry? Ethan Reed (a former Scholars' Lab fellow) has a great series of [blog posts](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/poems-with-pattern-and-vader-part-1-quincy-troupe/) on the Scholars' Lab website about sentiment analysis, a related form of text analysis that draws on machine learning to decide how positive or negative text is. Ethan's post on how these methods fail to account for the social and historical context of Black Arts Movement poetry is very helpful reading for how to think critically about these methods."
